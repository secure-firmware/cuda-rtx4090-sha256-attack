To optimize the performance of your CUDA-based password-cracking program, especially for cases where the index is large and computation time increases, you can consider several strategies. Here are some suggestions to improve performance:

1. Optimize Kernel Launch Configuration
Threads and Blocks: Ensure that your kernel launch configuration (number of threads per block and number of blocks) is optimized for your GPU. Experiment with different configurations to find the optimal setup.
Occupancy: Use tools like NVIDIA's CUDA Occupancy Calculator to determine the best configuration for maximizing occupancy on your GPU.
2. Memory Access Patterns
Coalesced Access: Ensure that memory accesses are coalesced. This means that threads in a warp should access consecutive memory addresses to maximize memory throughput.
Shared Memory: Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses, especially for frequently accessed data like the charset or intermediate hash values.
3. Reduce Divergence
Branch Divergence: Minimize branch divergence within warps. Ensure that threads within a warp follow the same execution path as much as possible.
Loop Unrolling: Consider unrolling loops where possible to reduce loop overhead and improve performance.
4. Optimize Hash Computation
Pre-compute Constants: If there are constants or values that can be pre-computed outside the kernel, do so to reduce computation within the kernel.
Efficient Hashing: Ensure that your SHA-256 implementation is efficient. Consider using optimized libraries or algorithms if available.
5. Use Multiple GPUs
Multi-GPU Setup: If you have access to multiple GPUs, distribute the workload across them to increase throughput.
6. Profile and Analyze
Profiling Tools: Use profiling tools like NVIDIA Nsight Systems or Nsight Compute to identify bottlenecks in your code.
Analyze Bottlenecks: Focus on optimizing the parts of the code that consume the most time or resources.
Example Adjustments
Here's an example of how you might adjust your kernel launch configuration:

```
// Example: Adjusting threads and blocks
int threadsPerBlock = 512; // Experiment with different values
int blocksPerGrid = (total_passwords + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;

// Launch kernel
find_password<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(start, end, d_target_password, d_found, d_result_index, d_salt, d_target_hash, d_result_hash);
```

Conclusion
Optimization is often an iterative process. Start by profiling your application to identify the most significant bottlenecks, then apply targeted optimizations. By experimenting with different configurations and techniques, you can improve the performance of your password-cracking program.
