Your implementation appears to cover the core functionality required for a basic SHA-256 hash computation, especially given the fixed input size of 14 bytes. However, there are a few enhancements and checks that can be made for robustness and completeness:

1. **Handling of Larger Inputs**:
   - If ever needed, extending to handle inputs larger than 14 bytes would require breaking the input into 64-byte blocks and managing multiple calls to `transform()`. Currently, it's optimized for your specific case.

2. **Padding Implementation**:
   - Make sure the padding logic correctly follows the SHA-256 specification, although yours should work with the inputs specified.

3. **Addition of Error Checking**:
   - Implement checks to ensure that the input does not exceed expected sizes, although your specific usage may not necessitate this.

4. **Input Management**:
   - Add an internal method to concatenate and manage input (password + salt) to ensure consistent input handling.

5. **Interface for Repeated Use**:
   - Consider adding a method to process multiple inputs in a series, in case you intend to hash multiple password and salt combinations.

6. **Utility Functions**:
   - Functions for converting inputs to/from hex or base64 could be useful depending on your requirements for output display or storage.

7. **Extended Testing**:
   - Verify the hash output against known SHA-256 results (test vectors) for correctness.

8. **Documentation and Error Handling**:
   - Add documentation for each function, explaining what it does to aid future development and maintenance. Include error handling and exceptions where applicable.

For your current context (short, fixed inputs), the implementation looks comprehensive in computational terms. If you plan to expand its use, some of the above recommendations might be useful. Let me know if there's something specific you want to delve into!
