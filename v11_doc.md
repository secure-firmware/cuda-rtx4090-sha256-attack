#### Looking at the SHA-256 implementation, here are the key optimization opportunities specifically for our 6-character password + salt use case:

1. Hard-code the input length:
Password is always 6 bytes
Salt is always 8 bytes
Total input is always 14 bytes
This means we only need one transform() call for the main data
2. Pre-compute initial states:
We can pre-compute the state after processing the salt
Store this in constant memory
Each thread only needs to process the password portion
3. Message schedule optimization:
Since input is fixed length, many message schedule words (m[16] to m[63]) will have patterns
We can pre-compute parts of these
Some message words will be constant zeros
4. Remove unnecessary padding logic:
We know exact input size
Padding pattern is fixed
Can be hardcoded into the transform
Would you like me to implement any of these optimizations first? The biggest gains will likely come from pre-computing the salt state and optimizing the message schedule.
