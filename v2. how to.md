Certainly! I'd be happy to help optimize the CUDA code for the RTX 4090 SHA-256 attack. Here are some optimization strategies we can apply to the existing code:

Use shared memory for frequently accessed data:

We're already using shared memory for the target hash, which is good.
We could also consider using shared memory for the charset if it's accessed frequently.
Unroll loops:

In the SHA-256 implementation, unrolling some of the loops (especially in the transform function) can improve performance.
Use intrinsic functions:

Replace some of the bitwise operations with CUDA intrinsic functions for potentially faster execution.
Optimize memory access patterns:

Ensure coalesced memory access where possible, especially when reading/writing to global memory.
Increase occupancy:

Experiment with different block sizes to find the optimal balance between parallelism and resource usage.
Use constant memory for read-only data:

We're already using constant for the K array and charset, which is good.
Reduce register usage:

If register pressure is high, consider using launch_bounds to optimize register allocation.
Use faster math functions:

Replace standard math functions with their faster (but slightly less accurate) counterparts where precision isn't critical.
Optimize data transfers:

Minimize host-to-device and device-to-host transfers.
Use pinned memory for faster transfers when necessary.
Implement asynchronous processing:

Use CUDA streams to overlap computation with data transfers and kernel executions.
Consider using multiple GPUs:

If available, distribute the workload across multiple GPUs for even more parallelism.
Would you like me to implement any specific optimizations from this list, or focus on a particular area of the code?
